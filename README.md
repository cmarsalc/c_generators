# C generators

This is a tiny C library inspired in Python generators. For now it only supports generators yiedling uint32_t values, but could be easily extended to other types of variables. A generic implementation could be done with MACROS, as C language has no support for templates.

The library does not use dynamic memory.

Examples can be found at the /examples folder.
